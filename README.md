# SVD Example Plugin
Example plugin on how to use the SVD API.

For information about the API, contact: `seniors` on discord.

### Disclaimer:
This is an example on how to use the SVD API, probably, a exception of the [Transpiler](https://github.com/Senior-S/SVD-Example-Use/blob/main/SVDLibrary/Patches/PlayerVoiceTranspiler.cs) class, everything else should be changed and adapted to your specific use.
