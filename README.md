# SVD Example Plugin
Example plugin on how to use the SVD API.

# What's SVD?
Steam Voice Decoder was originally an API which let's you decode any steam voice packet into a wav file, recently it got the encode endpoint too, which lets you send any wav data and receive the packets ready to be send.
The API is 100% free but it requires a whitelist, to get into the whitelist join my discord and open a ticket.

### Disclaimer:
This is an example on how to use the SVD API, probably, a exception of the [Transpiler](https://github.com/Senior-S/SVD-Example-Use/blob/main/SVDLibrary/Patches/PlayerVoiceTranspiler.cs) class, everything else should be changed and adapted to your specific use.

*If you're lazy and don't wanna manually handle stuff you can copy paste **[this](https://github.com/Senior-S/SVD-Example-Use/blob/main/SVDLibrary/ProjectMain.cs#L137)** function*
